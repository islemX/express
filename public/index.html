            <p class="text-small">Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, 
                Catalan, German, and English footballers led by Joan Gamper,
                 the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and
                 Catalanism, hence the motto "Més que un club" ("More than a club"). Unlike many other football clubs,
                  the supporters own and operate Barcelona.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Camp Nou was built between 1954 and 1957, and officially opened on the 24th of September 1957 with a match between 
            FC Barcelona and a selection of players from the city of Warsaw.
          The stadium replaced Barcelona’s previous ground Camp de les Corts, which,
         though it could hold 60,000 supporters, was still too small for the growing support of the club.
             Camp Nou initially consisted of two tiers that could hold 93,000 spectators.
             It was first called Estadi del FC Barcelona, 
            but got soon referred to as Camp Nou.</p>
